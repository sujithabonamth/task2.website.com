              Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise flow across borders. Where
              countries lower taxes, reduce red tape, and eliminate road blocks. Where companies import goods
              and merchandise directly into a Free Trade Zone without paying duties, fees, and taxes - and
              then export products duty and tax free.

              The Miami Free Trade Zone connects North America, Europe and Asia to Latin America and the
              Caribbean via direct air and sea transportation links, plus rail and expressway. Operated by FTZ
              World Services LLC, the 47-acre Zone saves companies money and time.
